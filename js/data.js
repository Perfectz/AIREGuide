    { title: "1. Garbage In, Garbage Out", content: "Be specific. 'Write a listing' is lazy and gives generic results. Provide concrete details like property type, location, features, and your target audience." },
    { title: "2. Show, Don't Just Tell (One-Shot vs. Few-Shot)", content: "<b>One-Shot:</b> Give one clean, detailed command for a fast result. This is your daily workhorse. <br><b>Few-Shot:</b> To get a specific style, provide examples. Say, 'Here are two of my best listing descriptions. Write a new one in the exact same style.' This trains the AI on what you consider 'good'." },
    { title: "3. One Task at a Time", content: "Don't overload the AI by asking for a listing, a tweet, AND an email at once. Focus on a single, clear task per prompt to get higher quality results." },
    { title: "4. Give It a Job, Give It a Vibe", content: "Tell the AI who to be. 'Act as a friendly local Realtor' or 'Act as a compliance-savvy broker.' This gives the output a more authentic, human voice that matches your brand." },
    { title: "5. Stay Out of Jail (Compliance First)", content: "Always include the command 'Ensure this is Fair Housing compliant.' But don't stop there‚Äîyou must still personally read and verify every output. The AI is a tool, not a lawyer." },
    { title: "6. The First Draft ALWAYS Sucks", content: "Treat the first output as a starting point, not the final product. Use follow-up prompts to refine it: 'Make it shorter,' 'Make it more casual,' or 'Add more detail about the backyard.'" }

    { title: "2. Segment & Name", content: "Identify 3‚Äì4 distinct buyer types from the data. Prompt ChatGPT: 'From this info, suggest buyer persona categories with catchy names.' For example, 'Urban Starter' or 'Upsizing Family.' Giving each a nickname makes them memorable." },
    { title: "3. Map Pain/Gain", content: "For each persona, list their top pain points and goals. Use ChatGPT to expand these: 'What are the biggest worries and hopes for an Upsizing Family buying a home?' This ensures your marketing addresses what truly matters to them." },
    { title: "4. Day-in-the-Life", content: "Humanize the persona with a story. Prompt: 'Write a 1-day narrative of an Upsizing Family couple home-shopping, highlighting their frustrations and wishes.' This story format spotlights powerful emotional triggers you can use in your copy." },
